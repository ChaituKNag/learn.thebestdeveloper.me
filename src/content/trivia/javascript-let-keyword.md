## `let` me explain 😝

JavaScript `let` keyword is a better replacement for var for the below reasons. This got introduced in ES6 (duh!)

* It has better scoping which is **block scope**. That means you can use `let` more confidently in loops without polluting the scope of the enclosing function.
* Because of **block scope**, the whole suite of scope related issues can be avoided.
* Unlike var, values declared using `let` are not hoisted, so you will not be able to use those values before the declaration.
* At root level if you declare a value using `let`, this will not add it to the window global object.
* Re-declaring `let` values will throw an error.
